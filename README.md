# Variant Classification Tool Performance Evaluation Project
This is a research project I worked on at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. </p>
https://emmayu18.github.io/Variant-Classifier-Evaluation/ </p>
I evaluated the performance of seven widely-used gene variant AI classification tools using variant data from ClinVar, OncoKB, and MyCancerGenome databases as the predicted data. </p>

## Objective
* Evaluate the performance of seven variant classification tool in missense variants of nine solid cancers with actionable genetic targets
* Visualize the performance metrics of variant classification tools

## Skills Displayed in This Project
* R, RMarkdown, CSS
* Data collection
* Data wrangling
* Statistical analysis
* Data visualization using `ggplot2`, `formattable`, and `fmsb`
* Research and scientific communication 

## File Outline
`data/`: folder containing csv file for the dataset and the rds save file for performance evaluation result </p>
`docs/`: folder containing the report HTML file hosted on GitHub Pages </p>
`report.Rmd`: RMarkdown distill article file containing the report </p>
`style.css`: css file used to customize the report HTML file </p>
`analysis.R`: R script file containing the code for the analysis </p>
`plot.R`: R script file containing the code for the plots </p>
`Variant-Classifier-Evaluation.Rproj`: R project setting storage </p>


## How to Use
If you want to view the report, check out https://emmayu18.github.io/Variant-Classifier-Evaluation/. </p>
If you want to play around with my code, feel free to download the `analysis.R` and `plot.R` files. Each script file contains all of the necessary packages and data. You also need to download the data located in the `data/` folder and the `Variant-Classifier-Evaluation.Rproj` for project organization.
